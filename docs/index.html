    <h1>AT-AT (Attack Tree Analysis Tool)</h1>

    <p>
        AT-AT (Attack Tree Analysis Tool) is an application that allows users to develop and analyze attack trees.
        The overall goal is to automatically generate a set of possible attack scenarios that can be used to provide
        guidance for how to improve the design of the system to which the attack tree belongs to. This project is a fork
        of <a href="https://github.com/yathuvaran/AT-AT">https://github.com/yathuvaran/AT-AT</a> and as such has many
        references to the original team and copied material. As we continue to update, it will and expand on the
        original.
    </p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Simplified DSL/CSV syntax to specify attack trees and a JSON format for parsed attack trees</li>
        <li>Parser to convert inputted attack trees into JSON (with syntax checker)</li>
        <li>Generates (i.e., visualizes) inputted attack trees</li>
        <li>Determines all attack scenarios on the inputted attack tree</li>
        <li>Lists all the possible attack scenarios and their severity for the inputted attack tree</li>
        <li>Provides recommendations to mitigate attacks in an attack scenario based on the metrics and keywords found
            in the scenario path</li>
        <li>Highlights a user-selected attack scenario on the tree</li>
        <li>Allows multiple trees to be modeled and analyzed at the same time by switching between tabs in the
            application</li>
        <li>Allows for the DSL/CSV syntax of a tree to be exported for reuse in the tool</li>
        <li>Generates an HTML report of the attack tree analysis which includes all attack scenarios and recommendations
        </li>
        <li>Generates a PDF file with the graphic of the attack tree</li>
        <li>Generates a PDF report of an individual scenario with the attack scenario tree graphic and the list of
            terminal nodes in the scenario</li>
    </ul>
